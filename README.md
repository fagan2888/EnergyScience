# EnergyScience
Cohort 14 Capstone Project for the Certificate of Data Science at Georgetown University School of Continuing Studies.
This project will attempt to build a model that forecasts thermal load for a building.

## Data instance
Given the Cooling load, heating load, and various other energy consumption sources like Fans, interior equipment/lights, weather conditions like temperature, builing information like type/location and holiday information, can we predict the overall electricity consumption load in a building on a future date
