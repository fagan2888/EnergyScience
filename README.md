# EnergyScience
Cohort 14 Capstone Project for the Certificate of Data Science at Georgetown University School of Continuing Studies.
This project will attempt to build a model that forecasts thermal load for a building.

# TODO
- * Evaluate SVM
- More Feature Analysis/EDA
- * Model evaluation with YellowBrick
- Hyperparameter tuning (Alpha value)
- * Story/Paper and slides
- Maybe a model per city (tentative)
